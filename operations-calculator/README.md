# Calculator

This is a simple calculator command. It's triggered, with `~calc`, and any mathematical expression afterward is *attempted* for evaluation. Most typical mathematical operations are supported, including trigonometry functions. No variables are supported.

Trigonometric functions expect *radians*, not degrees, so be prepared to include the conversion to or from degrees if you use trigonometry.

Matrix operations are supported; see https://github.com/gbenroscience/ParserNG for the rules of specification.
